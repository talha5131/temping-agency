                <h3>Employer</h3>

                <br>

                <p>We have been providing professional and experienced construction workers to our clients for a number of years and
                    have excellent knowledge of the industry. We won’t just place any candidates within your roles, we will provide the
                    best candidates to suit your needs and to support your projects.</p>

                <p>Most of the candidates on our database have been working regularly with us for a long time and we know exactly what they
                    can offer and who will fit in best for supporting your business.</p>

                <br>

                <h3> Right Worker On Right Time </h3>

                <br>

                <p>We understand that the nature of construction is to work at a fast pace and without the right people to support
                    projects, it can cause projects to fold. We also know that staff can let you down at the last minute, which is
                    why we will always be on hand to provide staff at short notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our philosophy is all about building strong relationships with our clients, which is why we want to build trust in our services.
                </p>

                <p>If you are a candidate looking for work, we will also strive to fit in with your schedule and provide you with as
                    much work as possible, when you need it. We will also keep in touch with you to ensure you are enjoying your work.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3> Our Recruitment Solutions for Clients </h3>

                <br>

                <p>At Labourer Agency UK, we can provide you with a full recruitment service for semi-skilled and skilled construction
                    workers. All you need to do is give us your requirements and we will do the rest.</p>

                <br>

                <h3> Advertise and Interview </h3>

                <br>

                <p>We have a large database of candidates to take care of your demands and if we can’t fill them with our candidates,
                    we will advertise on your account. We will also take care of the costs of the advertising, unless you are using
                    media, such as television or radio. We will shortlist candidates for you, only sending you the candidates who we
                    know fit your requirements. We will never send candidates to you without speaking to them first, so we know we
                    are only sending those who meet with your needs.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3> Last Minute Demands </h3>

                <br>

                <p>We have a strong reputation for being able to fill demands at short notice. We have worked in the construction
                    industry for a number of years and understand how quickly your demands can change, which is why we have candidates
                    who are flexible to cope at short notice and to changing demands.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3> Candidate Solutions </h3>

                <br>

                <p>We also have a full service for candidates and will try our best to adapt to your circumstances and offer you work which
                    suits in with your schedule. We will always contact the candidates on our database, before we advertise externally.
