				<h3> Event Staff Recruitment </h3>

				<br>

				<p>Event staff recruitment is a much specialised field in the recruitment industry. Many of the positions are seasonal while others require much sought after skills. Our consultants who work in this division are uniquely trained and experienced at dealing with clients and candidates who work within this industry.

					As with all our other divisions it would depend on the type of placement that will determine the candidate selected for that position.
					<br> <br> These positions could be full-time, part-time, permanent or temporary, it all depends on the type and duration of the event. It would also depend on the event companyâ€™s needs and requirements.</p>

				<br>

				<h3> Recruitment Agency London and Event Staff Recruitment </h3>

				<br>

				<p>Recruitment Agency London specialises in providing exceptional, skilled and experienced candidates to companies and other organisations. We recruit, advertise and screen potential candidates vigorously and do all the relevant skills tests to make sure that the candidates are ready to start working immediately or as soon as possible.

					As with any other industry the Events industry has many different levels of staff. We cater for candidates from very junior positions to those who work at the top level of their Â organisation.</p>

				<p>Candidates are allocated to clients and positions according to their qualifications, skills, their past experience as well as their chosen career path. Mostly this industry depends on mid- to short-term placements with a fast turnover of staff. The duration of the event also plays a major role when recruiting for these positions. Some events take years to prepare while other happen literally overnight. The candidates will have to be prepared to work under these terms and conditions.</p>
